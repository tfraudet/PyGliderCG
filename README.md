## Utility to import PP2 application data

PP2 or 'PesÃ©e des Planeurs v2" is and old WinDev application develop by the [GNAV](https://www.g-nav.org/) to calculate weights and balance for gliders. You can import database from this application using the following steps:

1. Convert all PP2 database files ```<filename>.fic```  that you want to recover using [HFDA tool](https://lapalys.ca/logiciels/hfda/) and save it as excel files.
2. Import converted excel files using ```pp2_import``` cli utility

To run pp2_import utility:

```bash
# import pp2 file FicPlaneur.fic previously converted to excel using HFDA
python pp2_import.py ./data/pp2_recovery/FicPlaneur.xls

# Get help of the cli
python pp2_import.py --help
```
